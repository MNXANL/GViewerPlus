# G Viewer Plus

Viewer from (GRAU-G) at FIB|UPC, only improved for home usage.

NOTE: The following folders are almost empty in order to save some space:
 * models
 * tests
 * Textures

There are, however, a few of those left there so you can try them a bit. I recommend downloading the rest from the subject's folder (for which you must be enrolled at the FIB)



Original viewer developed by C.And√∫jar [andujar*at*cs.upc.edu] et. al. Thank him for developing it, I just made some improvements :)
